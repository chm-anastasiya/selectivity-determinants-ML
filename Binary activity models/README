# Binary Activity Models – 5-HT Receptor Panel

This directory contains two Jupyter notebooks that train and analyse binary (active / inactive) classification models for six serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6, 5-HT7).

# Notebooks
---------
1. binary_activity_all_receptors.ipynb
- trains LightGBM classifiers (active = Ki < 1000 nM);
- uses ECFP4 fingerprints + RDKit descriptors;
- saves metrics, curves, feature rankings and model.pkl files under results/<receptor>/.

2. UMAP_activity_classification_all_receptors.ipynb
- projects the same feature space with UMAP;
- produces 2-D plots coloured by activity class;
- files are written to figs/UMAP_<receptor>.png.



# Input
-----
Cleaned ligand tables for each receptor  
(`cleaned_5HT1A.csv`, `cleaned_5HT2A.csv`, …) containing SMILES, Ki and RDKit descriptors.

# Output
------
results/<receptor>/
